# QR-Code-Scanner
A QR code scanner app is a mobile application designed to read and interpret QR codes. QR codes (Quick Response codes) are two-dimensional barcodes that contain information such as website URLs, contact details, text, and more. Here's a breakdown of how a QR code scanner app works and its main features:

How It Works:
Camera Access: The app uses your smartphone's camera to scan the QR code. When you open the app, it activates the camera and frames the code within a designated area.

Code Detection: The app processes the image captured by the camera to identify the QR code. It uses algorithms to decode the black-and-white pattern into meaningful data.

Data Interpretation: The decoded information is then displayed on the screen. This could be a website link, a contact card, text, or other data.

Action: Based on the type of information, the app might prompt you to take a specific action. For example, if it's a URL, it might ask if you want to open it in your browser.
